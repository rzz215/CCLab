                <span class="yellow">What do we know so far about the creature known as "Cloudy"? </span>The creature known as "Cloudy" is a peaceful and friendly entity.
                "Cloudy" likes to eat these blue flames known as, Will-O'-Wisps, which are known to be a spirit of some kind. "Cloudy" will turn into different colors after eating. If "Cloudy" doesn't eat after a certain amount of time it will start to shrink, eventually disappearing.
                Why it turns changes colors or disappears is unknown. The entity also seems to be constantly floating above the ground and has a face that is smiling unless hungry.
                <br>
                
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature: </span> We can interact with "Cloudy" by helping it eat the Will-O'-Wisps. We simply point in the direction of the flames and Cloudy will follow our directions, seemingly absorbing or 
                eating the flames. "Cloudy" must be fed the Will-O'-Wisps within a certain time period or else he will disappear for good. There are no other known methods of interaction with the creature as we are unable to touch it in any way.
